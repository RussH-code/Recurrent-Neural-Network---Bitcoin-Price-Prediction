## What is time series forecasting
A time series is a series of data indexed in time order. It usually describes a sequence taken at successive equally spaced points in time. The order of the data matters and cannot be shuffled. Examples include stock price, temperature records and hormone cycles. 

Time series forecasting involves taking models fit on historical data and using them to extrapolate future observations. Here we will look at using deep learning to perform time series predictions. Other common methods usually include regression analysis with an auto-correlation term.
